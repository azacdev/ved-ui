Welcome to Ved UI, a collection of beautifully designed and highly customizable components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com), [Zod](https://zod.dev), and [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com), Ved UI is designed to help you build forms and user interfaces at lightning speed while maintaining beauty, accessibility, and scalability.

  text="The moment I discovered shadcn/ui, I knew it was revolutionary. I saw the community's growing desire for more advanced and customizable form components, and that's why I created Ved UI - to help bridge that gap while maintaining the same philosophy of ownership and customization."

## Inspiration

Ved UI draws inspiration from two main sources:

1. **[shadcn/ui](https://x.com/shadcn)** - The foundation and philosophy behind Ved UI. Like shadcn/ui, this is not a component library but a collection of components you can copy, paste, and make your own. We build upon their excellent base components to create more advanced variations, especially for form management.

2. **[Zod](https://zod.dev)** - The seamless integration with Zod for validation ensures type safety and robust form handling, making Ved UI a powerful tool for developers.

## Why Ved UI?

- **Lightning-Speed Forms** - Build forms quickly with pre-built, customizable components.
- **Zod Integration** - Built-in validation with Zod for type-safe and scalable form handling.
- **React Hook Form** - Seamless state management and performance optimization with React Hook Form.
- **Highly Customizable** - Tailor components to fit your design system and requirements.
- **Accessible** - All components follow WAI-ARIA guidelines.
- **Dark Mode** - Built-in dark mode support for consistent user experiences.
- **TypeScript** - Written in TypeScript for type safety and developer confidence.

## Philosophy

Ved UI follows the same philosophy as shadcn/ui: giving you ownership and control over the code. We believe that:

1. You should be able to read, modify, and maintain your components.
2. Forms should be easy to build, validate, and manage without sacrificing performance.
3. Advanced features shouldn't come at the cost of accessibility.
4. Components should be easy to customize and extend to fit your unique needs.
